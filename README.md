# dominoes_java_edition
A Dominoes game written in Java. I also have made a [Python](https://github.com/thewinnt/dominoes_python_edition) version, as well as a [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/288062011) version that started it all.
**You need at least Java 8 to play the game (this will probably change in the future!).**

## Gameplay
Soonâ„¢. In the meantime, you can enjoy the main menu, which is absolutely identical to the Python version's one, except only the exit button works and there is no tutorial button. And there's no dark theme yet, sorry :(

# Getting the game
## Releases (stable)
You can find the full release versions at the [Releases](https://github.com/thewinnt/dominoes_java_edition/releases) tab.

## Building from source (unstable)
Download the source, start some sort of terminal (depending on your system) in the source folder, run `./gradlew desktop:dist`. Your JAR file will be located at (source)/desktop/build/libs. From there, you can put it wherever you want to and open it to play the game.
